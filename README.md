scripts
=======

A collection of scripts I've written to make my life easier. Use at your own risk.

Ones you might find particularly useful:
split_paragraphs.py
topicmodel.sh
mallet2graph.py

There is no guarantee that the logic in any of them is correct, but if you find errors, I'd appreciate knowing about it.
