scripts
=======

A collection of scripts I've written to make my life easier. Use at your own risk.

A process you might find useful:
1. split_paragraphs.py
2. topicmodel.sh
3. mallet2graph.py

There is no guarantee that the logic in any of them is correct, but if you find errors, I'd appreciate knowing about it.
